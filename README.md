I have just fixed a few things on the last Version of FFC. Ime still working on my own AC System, so dont exspect huge Changes here.

In general this Plugin is a great Protection against various Types of Flooding, ime just keeping it work as it should.

Since i havent implemented an Updater yet, watch this Project on GitHub so you will be informed about Updates.
